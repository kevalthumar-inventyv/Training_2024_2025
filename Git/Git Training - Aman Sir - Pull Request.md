## Pull Request

### what is a pull request?

A **pull request (PR)** is a way to propose changes from one branch to another in Git. It allows team members to review, discuss, and approve the changes before merging them into the target branch (usually `master` or `main`). PRs are commonly used in collaborative projects to ensure code quality and consistency.

### Step to do pull request:-

### **Pushing New Changes to the `feature1` Branch**

Once you've committed to your latest updates, itâ€™s time to push the changes to your feature branch. This ensures your local changes are synchronized with the remote repository.

### **Opening a New Pull Request**

With the changes pushed, the next step is to open a pull request. This allows you to review the changes and discuss them before merging them into the main branch.

### **No Conflicts or Branching Rules - Direct Merge Possible**

If there are no conflicts between the branches and no set branching rules, the pull request can be merged directly into the main branch without requiring any further steps.

### **Setting Branching Rules: Review Required Before Merge**

In the case where branching rules are enforced, the system requires at least one review before the pull request can be merged. This ensures that all changes are thoroughly reviewed by team members before integration.

### **After Review: Merging the Pull Request**

Once the review has been completed and approved, the pull request is ready to be merged. The merging process completes the integration of your feature into the main branch.

### Conclusion

The pull request process helps ensure smooth collaboration and high code quality. By pushing changes, opening a pull request, and following branching rules (like requiring reviews), teams can avoid conflicts and ensure only thoroughly reviewed code is merged. This organized workflow promotes transparency, reduces errors, and maintains project integrity.
